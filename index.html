            		<h2>Welcome to my website! I am Diyang Zhao.</h2>
            		<p>I'm a student graduated from Cornell, starting to look for roles in the circuit industry. As an ECE major, I'm fascinated by the analog circuit design that inspire our world. I've taken several projects and coursework about circuit design and have interned with two local cooperations. I'd like to put that experience to good use, push the world into a new phase.</p>
					<p>In my bachelor's program, I focus was analog and mixed signal VLSI. I designed an RFIC for NMR-screening of biological droplets. Our IC included almost all the major blocks we may use in analog VLSI, like low-noise amplifiers, mixers and filters. This work contained system level analysis, behavioral simulation, IC design, layout drawing as well as PCB, which improved my circuit design knowledge and strengthened my computer simulation skills. </p>
					<p>When pursuing my master's degree I also learned digital VLSI design and digital signal processing. I developed more methods to solve potential problems I may encounter during IC design. Currently, I am a Research Assistant in the computer system laboratory at Cornell University, designing the custom row/column memory. With two ports attaching to each memory cell, the data in this new type of memory can be read both by row and by column. In this project, I am gaining a deeper understanding of digital circuit design, which would help me add value in the RFIC design position. </p>
